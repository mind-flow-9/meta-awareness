# **Holons**

## **Definition**

> **Holon (n.)** â€” A unit that is simultaneously a whole in itself and a part of a larger whole. In relational and systemic contexts, a holon maintains its own integrity while contributing to and being shaped by the greater system it belongs to. Holons form nested hierarchies (holarchies) and are fundamental to understanding complex, interdependent structures in consciousness, relationships, and systems theory.

## **Description**

Holons live in the realm where selfhood meets systemhood.
